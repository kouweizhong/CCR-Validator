<h2>Welcome to the Open Health Data CCR Validation Service</h2>
<p>
	This validation service is still experimental.  It will test your ASTM E-2369-05 CCR XML
	instance against the standard XML Schema Document (XSD).  If it passes, it will 
	perform a series of tests based on constraints laid out in the E-2369-05 implementation 
	guide.  
</p>
<p>
	This validation service will also check the CCR instance against the constraints laid
	out in Meaningful Use.  This is the profile called RIN 0991-AB58.
</p>
<p>
	A list of all evaluated rules is at the bottom of the result.
</p>
<p>
	The validation service is setup using an open source rules engine and therefore, 
	additional validation tests can be added as "additional profiles" that are required 
	or optional (i.e. overall validation passes if errors during profile tests).
</p>
<p>
	Any bugs or questions can be entered on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccrvalidator/">project page</a>.
</p>

	By submitting your CCR instance for validation, you are giving the right for us to reuse
	the XML in whole or part to construct a testsuite for the CCR standard.
